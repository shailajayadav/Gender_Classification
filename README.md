# Gender_Classification
The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a set of body metrics.
Here I used python programming langauage.
You can find the code on demo.py file.
